# Lecture 1

## Notes

- Key points: To give you freedom of exploring various real data
- Questions
  - Science: few genes? genetic variation and personal health?
  - Technology: Robot, Nanotech, Genetics
- Information
  - Code of life: DNA/RNA sequence
  - Revolution of biology: sequencing technologies
  - Metagenomics: environmental, organismal
- Analysis
  - NGS data analysis: sequencing method + bioinformatics tool
- Modeling
  - Model:a mathematical or computational structure built on data for prediction or interpretation
  - Algorithm: a series of steps to solve a problem
- Hypothesis driven VS. Data driven

- Getting started
  - Document: Github, Markdown
  - Bioinformatics tutorial: a text editor, Docker


## Plan

- To master the use of at least one programming language
- To master the commonly used bioinformatics tools and databases, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis method study
- Participate in the research of bioinformatics related topics, learn the application of bioinformatics in specific fields, and improve the practical ability
